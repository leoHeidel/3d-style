# stylegan2-keras

Unofficial Tensorflow 2.3 and keras implementation of [StyleGAN2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958).

## Requirements

- tensorflow >= 2.3 
- GPU

## Example

See the [colab example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mnaWwrPHHmJ3aJ3js51daT0Jtuv9X9LL?usp=sharing). In this example the algorithm is applied to very small images (32x32) and not train for a long time. In order to get satisfactory results, colab is probably not enough.

## Acknowledgement
